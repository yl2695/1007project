	In this function, firstly, we select our all business in given state.
	
	Then, using the groupby-apply-combine method, we get a series of business_id 
	according to its total number of received review in descending order.
	(We assume that review counts would rightly reflect its popularity among the area.);
	Since in some state there are too many restaurants to plot in our canvas, 
	we may restrict the number of top popular to be smaller than a given threshold.
	
	For each business id in the Series, we will trace back to the review dataset, 
	find all historical reviews it has received,
	especially, we want to know how stars given by reviewers change over time.
	(As this might reflect the change of the quality in reality.)
	
	There might be a little problem that, since in some state there are not enough reviews, 
	for example: user inputs num_top=10, wanting to see top 10 popular restaurants in a given state,
	but we only have 5 restaurants records in this state. In this case, we can only plot min(num_top,len(review))=5
	subplots, this change would show on the plot title.
