Changes:

1.
Add InputCheck.py. This module includes two classes RestaurantName and StateName.
These two classes are used to check the validity of the input for restaurant names and State names.
So far I think RestaurantName can be deleted, I will explain this to you in the second section-Problems.

2.
Add RestAndStateNameCheckFuncs.py This module includes two functions: IsValidString and IsValidState.
These two functions are used in the two classes, RestaurantName and StateName, located under InputCheck.py

3.
Change names: SearchByNameMain.py -> SearchRestaurantsByName.py

4.
Change names: SearchFuncsExceptions.py -> Part1and4Exceptions.py

5.
Changes in Part1and4Exceptions.py:
 NameSearchNoResultError         unchanged 
StateSearchNoResultError        unchanged 
add InputNotStringError 
add RestNameContainNonAlphaError 
add StateNotStringError 
add StateNameContainNonAlphaError 
add  InvalidStateNameError
add NoValidPieChartForOneStateError

Problems:
1.
Bugs in unittest (3 failes in StateNameTests and I still have no clue)

2.
RestaurantName() still can’t handle some input correctly, cause some restaurants’ names have non alphabetic characters
such as - ‘ & # and numbers, which is hard to handle.  So I suppose that I can just ignore the input check for the
restaurants’ names and search for the input directly. However, there are also some bugs here.
For example: if you type in $ and then search, you will get too many results and none of them seems to have the special
character $.

Remark:
PieChartForOneState(state) can only apply to six states, I have added an exception for the invalid state values.
Please note this, and change the corresponding codes in guy.py
